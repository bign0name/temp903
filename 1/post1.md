# Three Foundations of Ancient China: Writing, Bronze, and Empire

Despite producing countless later achievements, three developments were the most historically significant to the creation of ancient Chinese civilization: oracle bone inscriptions, which gave China its first writing system and the ability to record history; bronze ritual vessels, which made possible metallurgy and ancestor-worship religion that defined Shang kingship; and the Terracotta Army, which symbolizes Qin Shi Huang’s unification of the warring states in 221 BCE and the birth of China as a single empire.
